# DevLab: I2C DRV2605L Haptic Motor Controller Module

## Introduction

The **DRV2605L Haptic Motor Controller Module** is a compact, easy-to-use board designed to provide high-quality haptic feedback for a wide range of applications. At its core is the DRV2605L IC from Texas Instruments, a highly integrated haptic driver that supports both Linear Resonance Actuators (LRA) and Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM) motors. This module enables precise and programmable vibration effects, making it ideal for wearables, handheld devices, robotics, and user interface prototyping.
